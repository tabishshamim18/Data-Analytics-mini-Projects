Welcome to my **Mini Data Analytics Projects Portfolio** — a collection of small, focused exercises designed to sharpen my skills in **SQL**, **Python**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**.

Unlike my end-to-end projects, this repository highlights quick, practical problem-solving tasks completed in short sessions (30 minutes to 2 hours). Each mini-project is structured to demonstrate **core analytical concepts**, **clean code**, and **practical business logic**.

## 🧠 About This Portfolio

This repository focuses on **building depth through repetition** — improving analytical problem-solving by tackling many small, targeted challenges.

These mini-projects help strengthen my:

- 🔍 SQL querying logic (joins, CTEs, window functions, aggregations)  
- 📊 Excel analysis and cleaning techniques  
- 🐍 Python data manipulation using Pandas  
- 📈 Power BI visual exploration and DAX practice
